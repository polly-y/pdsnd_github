### Explore US BikeShare Data
Part of the 'Programming for Data Science with Python' course.

### Introduction
In this project, I used Python to explore data related to bike share systems in three big cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington.

### How to run
The end goal of this project was to create an interactive experience in the terminal. Based on the user's input, different questions about the bike share systems were answered. 
Try this for yourself:
1) Place the bikeshare.py file and the three .csv files in the same folder. 
2) Run python bikeshare.py in your Terminal.
